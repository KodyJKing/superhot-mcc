Searching in Ghidra for labels starting with "PTR_PTR_s" (tables of strings) has been pretty fruitful. I found a table of entity category names. By looking at references to this, I found an entity category field on the entity structure. Looking for tables of strings like this might be generally useful for identifying variants of objects.
