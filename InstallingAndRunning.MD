Installing

    Place FW1FontWrapper.dll and MCCSuperHot.dll under:
        <MCC-Location>\mcc\binaries\win64\

Running

    1. Disable fullscreen mode if active, you can use borderless windowed instead for fullscreen.
    2. Load a Halo 1 level.
    3. Use a DLL injector to inject MCCSuperHot.dll into "mcc-win64-shipping.exe". I use cheat engine's DLL injector.
